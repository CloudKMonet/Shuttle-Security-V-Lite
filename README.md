# Shuttle Security V Lite

ðŸŽ® This has some the same Context (overall; but it does differ because I also explain that this is a recreation in a light weight form- but the context **is** the same in that it is from a capstone senior project and was a "real world assignment") and the Goals (one goal is as seen on my ReadME file and one is specifically one that I have made for myself to keep in mind).

## Context
ðŸ›¸ A security guard at our college came by our classroom to ask for students who could take on a big project in a short amount of time. The project in question was to develop a web application. The web application in question, would support students and campus security; as it would field students safe ride requests, keep a ticket history of those requests, check if the student was flagged for regular requests (or had a doctor's med note), as well as send a message to any student requesting a ride if an emergency occurs and halts the requests. Campus security also wanted to keep tangible data of the students ride requests (a database mock-up was required to keep track of the ticket history by log student's by id number, the driver's id number, when the ride was begun, when the ride ended and a short description of the ticket's requested location pickup/drop off), this would quantify whether or not more investment could be justified for college security's campus vans as they would be driving around campus responding to the safe ride requests. My team took the job- this version? Is my recreation of the major functions of the previous web app.

## Goals
ðŸš€ For the Web App: Streamline student ride requests for campus safe rides and reduce phone congestion for campus security.
ðŸ˜Ž For Myself: Recreating a code project that was initially created by my three other teammates and myself, into a light-weight version.
